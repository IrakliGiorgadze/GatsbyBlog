### qubit.

A qubit is a quantum bit, the counterpart in quantum computing to the binary digit or bit of classical computing. Just as a bit is the basic unit of information in a classical computer, a qubit is the basic unit of information in a quantum computer.

Here is a description from wikipedia on [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit): 

> Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)is
> a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or 
> dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, 
> cashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a 
> sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, 
> such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in 
> addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to 
> incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point 
> of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. 
> The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at 
> very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes 
> more malleable as its temperature increases.
